Galactic Gains Gym â€“ Project Management Simulation
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently focused on applying project management principles through a simulation aligned with the CompTIA Project+ (PK0-005) exam.

This project blends real-world planning with certification learning â€” through the fictional launch of Galactic Gains Gym, a fitness brand going digital.
